# Poker
Command Line Poker game 

# Development Status
Just started this project, so it's currently under development. Initial gameplay is being worked on. 
Initially the game will run as a poker game between bots alone. Once this works, hopefully the bots
can be trained by running several games against each other before allowing the user to join. 

The maximum table size will be 4 players. This can be either a table of 4 bots, or a table with
one real user and 3 bots.
